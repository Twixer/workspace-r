Scott Deerwester, Susan T. Dumais, George W. Furnas, Thomas K. Landauer, Richard Harshman;Indexing by Latent Semantic Analysis;1990;Journal of the American Society for Information Science;"A new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (""semantic structure"") in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. Initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."
Thomas K. Landauer, Peter W. Foltz, Darrell Laham;An Introduction to Latent Semantic Analysis;1998;Discourse Processes;"Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a theory and method for extracting and representing the contextual-usage meaning of words by statistical computations applied to a large corpus of text (Landauer & Dumais, 1997). The underlying idea is that the aggregate of all the word contexts in which a given word does and does not appear provides a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to each other. The adequacy of LSA's reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human word sorting and category judgments; it simulates word-word and passage-word lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in this issue, it accurately estimates passage coherence, learnability of passages by individual students, and the quality and quantity of knowledge contained in an essay."
Thomas K. Landauer, Susan Dumais;Latent semantic analysis - Scholarpedia;2008;Scholarpedia;Latent Semantic Analysis (also called LSI, for Latent Semantic Indexing) models the contribution to natural language attributable to combination of words into coherent passages. It uses a long-known matrix-algebra method, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which became practical for application to such complex phenomena only after the advent of powerful digital computing machines and algorithms to exploit them in the late 1980s. To construct a semantic space for a language, LSA first casts a large representative text corpus into a rectangular matrix of words by coherent passages, each cell containing a transform of the number of times that a given word appears in a given passage. The matrix is then decomposed in such a way that every passage is represented as a vector whose value is the sum of vectors standing for its component words. Similarities between words and words, passages and words, and of passages to passages are then computed as dot products, cosines or other vector-algebraic metrics. (For word and passage in the above, any objects that can be considered parts that add to form a larger object may be substituted.)
Fridolin Wild;An LSA package for R;2007;Mini-Proceedings of the 1st European Workshop on Latent Semantic Analysis in Technology-Enhanced Learning;Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is an algorithm applied to approximate the meaning of texts, thereby exposing semantic structure to computation. LSA combines the classical vector-space model - well known in computational linguistics - with a singular value decomposition (SVD), a two-mode factor analysis. Thus, bag-of-words representations of texts can be mapped into a modified vector space that is assumed to reflect semantic structure. In this contribution the author describes the lsa package for the statistical language and environment R and illustrates its proper use through an example from the area of automated essay scoring. 
Unknown;Latent semantic analysis - wikipedia;2015;Wikipedia;Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a technique in natural language processing, in particular in vectorial semantics, of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms. LSA assumes that words that are close in meaning will occur in similar pieces of text. A matrix containing word counts per paragraph (rows represent unique words and columns represent each paragraph) is constructed from a large piece of text and a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the number of rows while preserving the similarity structure among columns. Words are then compared by taking the cosine of the angle between the two vectors (or the dot product between the normalizations of the two vectors) formed by any two rows. Values close to 1 represent very similar words while values close to 0 represent very dissimilar words. An information retrieval method using latent semantic structure was patented in 1988 (US Patent 4,839,853) by Scott Deerwester, Susan Dumais, George Furnas, Richard Harshman, Thomas Landauer, Karen Lochbaum and Lynn Streeter. In the context of its application to information retrieval, it is sometimes called Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI).
Thomas K. Landauer, Susan T. Dumais;A Solution to Plato's Problem: The Latent Semantic Analysis Theory of Acquisition, Induction, and Representation of Knowledge;1997;Psychological review;"How do people know as much as they do with as little information as they get? The problem takes many forms; learning vocabulary from text is an especially dramatic and convenient case for research. A new general theory of acquired similarity and knowledge representation, latent semantic analysis (LSA), is presented and used to successfully simulate such learning and several other psycholinguistic phenomena. By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. Relations to other theories, phenomena, and problems are sketched."
Peter W. Foltz, Walter Kintsch, Thomas K. Landauer;The measurement of textual coherence with Latent Semantic Analysis;1998; Discourse Processes;Latent Semantic Analysis is used as a technique for measuring the coherence oftexts. By comparing the vectors for two adjoining segments of text in a highdimensional semantic space, the method provides a characterization of the degree of semantic relatedness between the segments. We illustrate the approach for predicting coherence through re-analyzing sets of texts from two studies that manipulated the coherence of texts and assessed readers' comprehension. The results indicate that the method is able to predict the effect of text coherence on comprehension and is more effective than simple term-term overlap measures. In this manner, LSA can be applied as an automated method that produces coherence predictions similar to propositional modeling. We describe additional studies investigating the application of LSA to analyzing discourse structure and examine the potential of LSA as a psychological model of coherence effects in text comprehension.
Thomas K. Landauer, Danielle S. McNamara, Simon Dennis, Walter Kintsch;Preface;2007;Handbook of latent semantic analysis;Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a theory and method for extracting and representing the meaning of words and passages of words. Meaning is estimated using statistical computations applied to large corpora of text. As a representative sample of human language experience, text embodies the same mutual constraints that determine the semantic similarity of words and sets of words for people. A basic tenet of this approach is that human cognition has been optimized to the structure of the environment, so to understand cognition one should try to find rigorous models that match natural human achievements. LSA has been highly successful both as a theory of verbal meaning and cognition and as a practical tool for measuring similarities and differences of meaning.
